# SepMark
The implementation of the paper "SepMark: Deep Separable Watermarking for Unified Source Tracing and Deepfake Detection".  
Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06321

We provide the models of SepMark that were trained using SimSwap(), GANimation(), and StarGAN (Male) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h93NcAJXE21CsDluMyDdBdKGY5aV1pLC?usp=sharing). Due to license agreements, we are unable to distribute their codes ourselves. However, we believe that you can re-implement them or other Deepfakes on your own. Here are some links to their repositories, including [SimSwap](https://github.com/neuralchen/SimSwap), [GANimation](https://github.com/vipermu/ganimation), [StarGAN](https://github.com/yunjey/stargan), [FaceSwap](https://github.com/guipleite/CV2-Face-Swap), [Roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop), and [MobileFaceSwap](https://github.com/Seanseattle/MobileFaceSwap). Best Wishes.
